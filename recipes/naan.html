    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar, or more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, to taste</li>
        <li>5 1/2 cups bread flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. 
            Let stand until bubbly and frothy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in milk, egg, salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. 
            Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes. 
            Place dough into a well oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and set 
            aside to rise until the dough has doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and knead well. For garlic naan, 
            knead in garlic at this point.</li>
        <li>Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of golf balls. 
            Roll into balls, cover with a clean cloth, and allow to rise until 
            doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Roll out 2 balls of dough into elongated ovals. 
            Place on an ungreased baking sheet and cook under the broiler until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. 
            Brush butter on both sides and flip. Continue broiling until the second side is firm and golden, 
            2 minutes more. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
    </ol>
